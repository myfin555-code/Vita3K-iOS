# Tsubomi

**Tsubomi** is an experimental PlayStation Vita emulator for iOS (iPhone/iPad).

Tsubomi is a **fork of [Vita3K](https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K)** and uses it as its
emulation base. All of the heavy lifting — the CPU, GPU (GXM→Vulkan/MoltenVK), kernel
and module HLE — is Vita3K's work; Tsubomi adds a native iOS front-end, an on-device
import pipeline, a touch controller, and the platform glue needed to run on a
non-jailbroken iPhone with JIT. Please support the upstream Vita3K project.

## ⚠️ Legal / piracy disclaimer

Tsubomi does **not** condone or support piracy or any other illegal activity.

- You must **dump your own games and firmware from hardware you own.** Do not download
  games you do not own.
- Tsubomi ships with no games, firmware, or keys, and none are provided.
- Booting Vitamin dumps or other pirated content is not supported.

By using Tsubomi you agree that you are solely responsible for the content you load and
that you are complying with the laws in your jurisdiction.

## Requirements

- An iPhone/iPad on iOS 16.0 or later (including 17, 18 and 26), with a way to sideload an unsigned `.ipa`.
  See [iOS compatibility, JIT setup and native keyboard validation](ios/COMPATIBILITY.md) for prerequisites and pending device checks.
- **JIT** must be enabled for games to run (Tsubomi shows a banner and refuses to boot
  games when JIT is unavailable). [StikDebug](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug)
  or a comparable JIT enabler works.
- Your own **PS Vita firmware** and **game dumps**.

## Setup

1. Sideload the unsigned `Tsubomi.ipa` and enable JIT for it (e.g. via StikDebug).
2. Launch Tsubomi. On first run it creates its data folder at
   **`Documents/Tsubomi`** (visible in the Files app — file sharing is enabled).
3. Add content with the **+** button in the library:
   - **Import game (.vpk / .zip)** — a Vita app package.
   - **Import firmware (.PUP)** — a PS Vita firmware update.
   - If a game is a NoNpDrm dump, Tsubomi prompts for its **work.bin** license and
     decrypts the content in place.
   Alternatively, copy your desktop **Vita3K** data folder into
   `Documents/Tsubomi/vita` in the Files app and tap **Refresh**.

### Data layout (`Documents/Tsubomi/`)

```
Tsubomi/
  vita/            the Vita filesystem (ux0, vs0, sa0, …)
    ux0/app/<TITLEID>/        installed games
    ux0/user/00/savedata/     save data
    ux0/license/              NoNpDrm .rif licenses
  cache/           shader / pipeline caches (persist across reinstalls)
  tsubomi.log      the log file — attach this when reporting issues
```

`Documents` survives app reinstalls, so games, saves, and firmware are kept when you
sideload a new build.
